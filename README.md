### Summary

This was my first project working with Ruby! I made a console app that had users pick a number and the computer performed a binary search to guess it. My first programming language was JavaScript, so learning Ruby has been fun and interesting! Ruby's syntax is definitely more lightweight.

### Project Goals

- [x] Create a console app with Ruby
- [x] Greet the user and get the user's name
- [x] Have the user pick (in their head) a number between 1 and 1000
- [x] Have the computer perform a binary search to determine the number in 10 tries or less
- [x] Provide the option to play again

### Technologies Used
